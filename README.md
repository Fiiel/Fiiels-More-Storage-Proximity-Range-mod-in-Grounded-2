# More-Storage-Proximity-Range-in-Grounded-2
This is a mod in Grounded 2 that increases the range in which you can craft from containers and hot-deposit items into storage/chests.
Currently, the default or vanilla value of the proximity range in-game is 20 cm (or 2000.0). **This mod increases that to 80 cm (or 8000.0).** 

## Installation
