# More-Storage-Proximity-Range-in-Grounded-2
This is a mod in Grounded 2 that increases the range in which you can craft from containers and hot-deposit items into storage/chests.
Currently, the default or vanilla value of the proximity range in-game is 20 cm (or 2000.0). **This mod increases that to 40/60/80/100 cm (or 4000.0/6000.0/8000.0/10000.0).** 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only tested on Steam. Works with **Game Version 0.1.1.3 Rel 1954911**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DOES NOT affect the range of plank and weed stem storage pallets.
